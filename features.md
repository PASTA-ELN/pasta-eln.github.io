# Features
These features are already working and tested.

## Four modules
### Project management
- The project-tasks-subtask hierarchy exist and can be extended. They are called x0, x1,...
- TODO,WAIT,DONE are transferred into tags, in both directions and used for highlighting in the GUI
### Measurements
- found automatically by scanning
- curation allows to add tags, annotations, changing of display
- Meta-data
  - can have multiple origins
  - metaVendor: meta-data generated by the vendor: currents in TEM, ...
  - metaUser: meta-data generated by the [extractors](extractors) which is written by the scientist: identified maximum load
### Samples
Can have a QR code
### Procedures
Can link to a file on the filesystem. Here the path is often the name
### Other document types can be defined


## Filesystem interaction
### Automatic inclusion of measurements
### Filesystem used to store data
- inclusion of data from remote storage works: if it has https:// in its name
### full export incl. database entries
- full backup, compare and restore of database and backup-file
- save json (future xml/html are possible but do not allow easy comparison)
- automatically zipped


## Methods to ensure consistent, reliable database
### Revisions of all entries are saved in database
### Measurements have sha-sum which can be verified
These files are protected against tempering.
### Unit test are run often on backend and frontend
- install-script testing is more troublesome since it requires a newly installed windows/linux system.
### Call-stack saved for all entries
- allows to identify which code changed which entry
