# Extractors
This page should become an overview on extractors. Those are little python programs that 'extract' metadata, thumbnails and user-metadata from the raw files. These little programs can be written/adopted by scientists and can be shared. The PASTA extractors will follow the standard of TheELNConsortium [https://github.com/TheELNConsortium]

General information on file formats can be found:

# Ignored files
Files are ignored if they do not have an extractor or if they are in '.gitignore'.
These files can be produced as intermediate files during processing (e.g. Latex: .bcf, .pdf, .run.xml, .synctex.gz, .aux).
